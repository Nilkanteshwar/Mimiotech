    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective date: February 13, 2026</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>This Refund Policy outlines refund handling for Mimiotech Consulting Services. Because most services are customized consulting and recruitment services, refund eligibility is limited and evaluated case-by-case.</p>

    <h2>General policy</h2>
    <p>Fees for completed service milestones are generally non-refundable unless otherwise stated in a signed agreement.</p>

    <h2>When refunds may apply</h2>
    <p>Refund requests may be considered in case of duplicate payments, billing errors, or non-delivery of agreed paid scope where required documentation is provided.</p>

    <h2>How to request a refund</h2>
    <p>Send your request to <a href="mailto:info@mimiotech.com">info@mimiotech.com</a> with payment reference, invoice details, and reason for request. We review requests within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

    <h2>Processing timeline</h2>
    <p>Approved refunds are typically processed to the original payment method. Processing time depends on banking and payment providers.</p>

    <h2>Agreement precedence</h2>
    <p>If a signed client agreement contains specific billing and refund terms, that agreement takes precedence over this website policy.</p>
